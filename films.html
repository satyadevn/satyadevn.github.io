<h1>Films</h1>

<p> A list of films I've seen recently, and like. </p>

<p>The films are listed roughly in reverse chronological order 
in which I've seen them.</p>

<ol>

<li>The Intruder (1962), starring William Shatner, about a
rabble-rouser fighting integration.</li>

<li>Night of the Hunter (1955), directed by Charles Laughton (who
played the lawyer in &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;), and
starring Robert Mitchum as a creepy &quot;preacher&quot;</li>

<li>Solyaris, by Andrei Tarkovsky. One of my favorite movies of all
  times - it is impossible to describe why. But the hypnotic long
  shots and the dreamy Bach composition subtly modified by Eduard
  Artemyev has a lot to do with it. It seems Lem was furious with this
  movie - he should be, it is far superior to his novel.</li>

<li>Mississippi Burning (1988)</li>
