    <p>This is a homepage.</p>

    <p>You might be interested to know my thoughts regarding the
      ongoing course, in my <a href="noc15.html">course blog</a> on the
      NPTEL C programming course.</p>

    <p>I have several
      other <a href="satyadev.livejournal.com">opinions</a> as well.

    <p>This website was created
    on <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">Emacs</a>, and does
    not use any javascript. The blog was created
    with <a href="http://www.orgmode.org">Org mode</a>, an emacs
    mode. This mode, among other useful facilities, allows generation
    of HTML files from a more readable syntax. Another similar
    methodology is "Markdown", but I prefer org-mode.</p>

    <p>Version management for this site is done via git, please see a
    nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYjZtU1-u9Y">tutorial</a>
    here.</p>
